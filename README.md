=== What is it? ===
SQLBans is an advanced banning, kicking, warning and muting system developed to store all records in a database for easy retrieving of a players stats. Since it's SQL it is very fast and efficient, and can be accessed from multiple locations and languages such as PHP (to make a web interface).

=== How it works ===
All Bans, kicks warnings and mutes are stored into a database, they act the same as any other plugin, but allow for lookups, even if a player has been pardoned or unmuted.
